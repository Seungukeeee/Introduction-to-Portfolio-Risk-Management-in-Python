ABOUT

- Logistic regression for probability of default
</aside>

- Probability of default
    - the likelihood that someone will default on a loan is the probability of default(in other words, it is the probability that the likelihood of someone will fail to repay a loan).
    - this is expressed as a probability which is a value between zero and one.
    - these probabilities are associated with our loan status(Yes or No) column where 1 is a default, and 0 is non default.

    - In the industry, two models are used frequently.
        - Logistic regression: it is like a linear regression, but only produces a value between 0 and 1. they perform better on data **what determines a default or non-default can vary greatly**.
