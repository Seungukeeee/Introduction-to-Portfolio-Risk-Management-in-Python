- Monte Carlo simulations

Since one random simulation wonâ€™t suffice for an accurate estimate of anything, you can repeat the simulation hundreds, thousands, or even millions of times to create a massive range of possible outcomes - a Monte Carlo simulation. You can then study these ranges of outcomes in the same way that you studied historical values to compute historical value at risk.
