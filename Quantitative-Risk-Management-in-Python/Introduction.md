### üîÅ Think of it as a 2-Step Process

1. **Risk Exposure Estimation**
    
    `covariance @ weights`
    
    ‚ûú How exposed each asset is to overall portfolio risk, based on its co-movement with others and their sizes.
    
2. **Realized Risk Contribution**
    
    `weights.T @ (...)`
    
    ‚ûú How much each asset's exposure actually **impacts** portfolio variance, based on its own size.
